### FullStack E-Commerce Application  
I built a full stack REST API e-commerce app.
You can register your account and log in.
After you logged in, you will see list of products.
You can add, edit or delete your produdcts.
If you would like to buy a product, just click on add to basket button.
Also you can filter products depending on their category name, or search a product by it's name.
